One of my favorite television shows is The Big Bang Theory. I was watching it recently when Sheldon introduced us with his take on the game of rock, paper, scissors. I hope you too have fun with the game. To play these games, simply copy my code and run it through a Python compiler. Have fun
The game rules is given below:
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
Have fun :)
